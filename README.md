## File Encryption and Timing Tool

This repository contains a set of Python scripts for encrypting and obfuscating the contents of a file, as well as timing the execution of a script.

## Scripts

### `main.py`

This script is used to encrypt and obfuscate the contents of a file. It takes a file path as a command-line argument and performs the following steps:

1. Reads the contents of the specified file.
2. Applies character shifting to the file contents using a randomly generated shift value.
3. Encrypts the shifted contents using multiple layers of compression and encoding (base64, base16, base85, and base32).
4. Writes the encrypted contents to a new file with the same name as the original file, but with the suffix `-encrypted.py`.

To use this script, run the following command:

```
python main.py /path/to/file.py
```


### `rtime.py`

This script is used to measure the execution time of a script. It takes a file path as a command-line argument and performs the following steps:

1. Reads the contents of the specified file.
2. Executes the script five times.
3. Calculates the average execution time across the five runs.
4. Prints the average execution time to the console.

To use this script, run the following command:

```
python rtime.py /path/to/script.py
```

## Dependencies
